# Mio Zoomer

OK Zoomer unofficial architectury port.

Mio Zoomer is a mod that adds a configurable feature-packed zoom key, which allows for zooming. By default, the zoom key is bound to `C` with the zoom itself being different, with features like zoom scrolling, smooth transitions and reduced mouse sensitivity.

However, this isn't the end of the story, because here, you are in charge of your own zoom! Through the config screen, which is accessible through either the `/mio_zoomer` client command or the Mod Menu, the zoom is completely configurable, and if the default behavior isn't exactly what you want, you can change the smallest details or even restore the OptiFine zoom with a press of a button!
